# Sound-Analyzer_Car-Engine-diagnosis
## Objective
Program to diagnose the car engine issues based on noise analysis
## Procedure
* Implemented a program logic based on Blind Source Separation Technique Using Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (Initial approach was Spectral subtraction â€“ Image based, Numerical based, was not successful because of noise from external environment)
* Tested a program on engine noise recording along with musical sound.  Successfully able to separate the noise components using a Blind Source Separation Technique.
## Techniques
Spectral Analysis, Spectral Subtraction, Blind Source Separation.
## Industrail Use
Vocal and non-vocal separation from music, Separation of Instrument Sounds
## Results
## Engine sound - spectrogram
